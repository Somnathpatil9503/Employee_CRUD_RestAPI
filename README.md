In this project we apply CRUD operation by hitting api vai POSTMAN (no UI based functionality)

1 st we create Employee.java class and declare attributes in it after that we connect DB by writing some properties in application.properties file once we connect db to spring application the vai jpaRepository we direct access all CRUD operation
so its quite simple project so please
